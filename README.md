Swarm Wars is a fast-paced, retro-style space shooter where you command a fleet of ships in chaotic, multiplayer battles. 
Inspired by the frenetic energy of Fortnite and classic arcade games, it pits players and bots against each other Battle Royale.
Dodge asteroids, grab power-ups, and outmaneuver your foes to claim victory!

Developed as a collaborative project with ideas from horseywin, this game combines pixel-art aesthetics with modern gameplay mechanics, offering a nostalgic yet fresh experience.
